Setup

First navigate to the project, then run 
```bash
npm install
```

After installing necessary serve dependencies navigate to the app folder using
```bash
 cd cutty-url
```

Then run 
```bash
npm install
```
Then run 
```bash
ng build
```

navigate out of the app directory using
```bash
 cd ..
```
To run the server and app use 
```bash
 node.index.js
```

After this the console will give you a location for the server probably at
```bash
http://localhost:4103
```
This project has a very general key located in
```bash
/CuttyUrl/config.js
```
This should be changed before production
